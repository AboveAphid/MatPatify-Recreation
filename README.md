[CUT TO BLACK OR SOMETHING IDK]



PS: Btw to the devs that might be yelling at the bad coding practices in this browser extension. Uhh sorry. I just kinda winged it since I haven't made a (proper) extension before.

## Actual Description
This is my recreation of the MatPatify chrome extension.

To download and use you can git clone this repo and use `load unpacked` option in your browser on the `MatPatify Recreation Tutorial` folder.
And that should make you able to use it.

I won't be publishing this on the chrome extension store as this is just a remake of another extension so people can see how such things are accomplished.
And I don't want to take credit from the original extension.
Which you can access here btw: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/matpatify/cgicnmnonpkpbgmboekkjdbckihlhajf

Also here is my YT tutorial on how to make it if you are intrigued: YT_LINK
